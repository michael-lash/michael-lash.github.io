This course takes a data-centric approach to machine learning, focusing on nontraditional data types, particularly text, networks/graphs, and images. These data types have become ubiquitous, invaluable sources of information and insight spanning the spectrum of industries and enterprise. It is therefore imperative that business analysts, data scientists, and machine learning practitioners have competency in not only dealing with these sources of data but in gleaning the treasure-trove of insights such data provide. This course equips students with the skills necessary to acquire, process, and learn from text, networks, and images, building on the foundations learned in the introduction to machine learning course (recommended, but not required). The primary emphasis in this course is text data; select lectures will be devoted to working with networks and images.
