2016  Early predictions of movie success: The who, what, and when of profitability  Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS)  This paper investigates the predictability of movie success (profit) utilizing features (variables) strictly available during the pre-production stage. We investigate the features that are important to the prediction problem and propose a "Movie Investor Assurance System" (MIAS).  M.T. Lash and K.

2017  A budget-constrained inverse classification framework for smooth classifiers  2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)  We propose a method and framework for the inverse classification problem that assumes the model in question is differentiable with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient.

2017  Generalized Inverse Classification  Proceedings of the 2017 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM)  We propose an updated optimization methodology to generalize the inverse classification involving only very minor assupmtions. The proposed method and framework can be used with virtually any classifier.  M.T. Lash, Q. Lin, W.N. Street, J.G. Robinson and J.
