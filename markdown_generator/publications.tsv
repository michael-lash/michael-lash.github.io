2016  Early predictions of movie success: The who, what, and when of profitability  Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS)  This paper investigates the predictability of movie success (profit) utilizing features (variables) strictly available during the pre-production stage. We investigate the features that are important to the prediction problem and propose a "Movie Investor Assurance System" (MIAS).  M.T. Lash and K.
