I am an assistant professor in the [Analytics, Information, and Operations Management Area](https://business.ku.edu/research-and-faculty/analytics-information-operations-management) at the [University of Kansas School of Business](https://business.ku.edu/). Before joining the University of Kansas School of Business, I served as a visiting assistant professor at the [University of Iowa Tippie College of Business Business Analytics Department](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/about/business-analytics-department). I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Iowa in the Winter of 2018 under the supervision of Drs. [W. Nick Street](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/people/nick-street) and [Alberto M. Segre](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/alberto-segre).

My work has appeared in a variety of peer-reviewed journals including the Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS), Journal of Business Research (JBR), and Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA), among others. My work has also appeared in numerous rigorously peer-reviewed conferences including the SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM), the IEEE International Conference on Health Informatics (ICHI), and the IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM), among others.

My research interests are broadly in the areas of data mining, machine learning, and business analytics.
